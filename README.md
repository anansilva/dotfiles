# Ana's dot files

## Installation

WIP: Still needs improvement

  `git clone git://github.com/anansilva/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
  `cd ~/.dotfiles`
  `source ~/.dotfiles/.zshrc`
  `slz` This will symlink the zsh files
  `slv` This will symlink the vim files

  Vim plugins are managed through vundle. You'll need to install vundle to get them.
